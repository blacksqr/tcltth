HIGH:

* Check the context name for existense in [tth update].

* Implement -chan for [tth].

* Implement -hex for [tth].

* Check how -base32 and -raw work for [tiger].

* Write tests to test -raw output of [tth] and [tiger].

LOW:

* Move base32 impl. directly to DigestToBase32().

* Write more tests, also for syntax issues after the implementation
  is complete and interfaces are stable.

* Write a script to convert NESSIE testvectors to tcltest tests
  and run the implementation through them.
  Handcrafting of the test suite is also plausible.
