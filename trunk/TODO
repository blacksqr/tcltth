HIGH:

* Move base32 impl. directly to DigestToBase32().

* Check how -base32 and -raw work for [tiger].

* Write tests to test -raw output of [tth] and [tiger].

* Write THEX tests for -string and -context forms of [tth].

LOW:

* Implement -192, -160 & -124 options for output format.

* More comments in source code.

* Write more tests, also for syntax issues after the implementation
  is complete and interfaces are stable.

* Write a script to convert NESSIE testvectors to tcltest tests
  and run the implementation through them.
  Handcrafting of the test suite is also plausible.

* Check whether we can get rid of the word64 type in the tiger.c
  (and tigertree.c) since at least the first seem to operate
  on bytes, not wide ints.

* Study the possibility of implementing mmap()'ped reading
  of file (via -mmap option to [tth]): look for Metakit.
  cons: no Tcl-way cross-platform solution; code will almost
        certainly differ for POSIX and Windows.
  pros: potentially faster than Tcl channels + no problems
        with ensuring the channel is binary and readable.
