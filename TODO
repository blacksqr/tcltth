HIGH:

* Implement -192, -160 & -124 options for output format.

* Comment code in generic/tcl*.c;

* Make tests more systematic after API stabilization.

* Try to implement mmapping on win32:
  CreateFileMapping, MapViewOfFile and UnmapViewOfFile.

* Move base32 impl. directly to DigestToBase32().

* Check how -base32 and -raw work for [tiger].

* Write tests to test -raw output of [tth] and [tiger].

* Write THEX tests for -string and -context forms of [tth].
  Probably done (?)

LOW:

* Write more tests, also for syntax issues after the implementation
  is complete and interfaces are stable.

* Write a script to convert NESSIE testvectors to tcltest tests
  and run the implementation through them.
  Handcrafting of the test suite is also plausible.
